## 🚀 Quick Start (3 steps)

### 1️⃣ Read Instructions
Open [`INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) - detailed guide with screenshots info

### 2️⃣ Copy Script to Kaggle
- Go to https://www.kaggle.com/code
- Create new notebook
- Copy contents of `resnet18_cifar10.py`
- Paste into Kaggle
- **Enable GPU** (Settings → GPU T4)

### 3️⃣ Run & Report
- Click "Run All"
- Wait ~5-10 minutes
- Copy output back to project

---

## ✅ Local Verification (Optional)

Before uploading to Kaggle, verify code works:

```bash
cd /workspaces/GDSearch
python kaggle/verify_local.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ All local tests passed!
Ready to run on Kaggle
```

## 📊 What We're Testing

**Experiment**: ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 with Custom Adam

**Purpose**: Verify custom optimizers work with:
- ✅ Deep networks (18 layers)
- ✅ Skip connections (residual blocks)
- ✅ Large models (11M parameters)
- ✅ Modern architectures

**Expected Results**:
- Training completes without errors
- Loss decreases over epochs
- Test accuracy ~60-70% after 5 epochs
- GPU training time: 5-10 minutes

## 🎯 Current Status

- [x] Code created and verified locally
- [ ] Run on Kaggle with GPU
- [ ] Copy results back
- [ ] Update docs/LIMITATIONS.md
- [ ] Mark Phase 12 complete

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use GPU**: Without GPU, training takes hours
2. **Enable Internet**: Needed to download CIFAR-10 dataset  
3. **Copy Everything**: The script is self-contained (no imports needed)
4. **Watch Progress**: You'll see loss/accuracy update in real-time

## 📝 After Running

Share this info:
- Device used (GPU model)
- Training time
- Best test accuracy
- Any errors

I'll then:
1. Verify results
2. Update documentation
3. Mark limitation #8 as complete
4. Continue with next improvements
